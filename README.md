# 📊 Canada Census Data Processing & Visualization

This project provides a streamlined pipeline to process Canadian census data and generate population metrics summaries for various geographic regions (age distributions, population totals, growth rates, median household income, and unemployment rates). It is designed to support further analysis, reporting, and dashboard development using tools such as **Streamlit**.

## 📌 Introduction

The objective of this project is to automate the processing of structured census data and make insights accessible through visualizations. It focuses on:

- Age-wise population segmentation  
- Population growth analysis between census years  
- Economic indicators such as median household income and unemployment rates  
- Generating clean, structured outputs for analytics or reporting workflows

An interactive **Streamlit** application is included, allowing users to upload a `.csv` file and view region-specific insights with a dropdown interface.

> 📘 **Note**: The entire preprocessing pipeline—including data cleaning, transformation, and output generation—is demonstrated in the `technical_test.ipynb` notebook. Read further below to run Streamlit application.
